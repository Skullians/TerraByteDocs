To configure your defence you must specify a projectile (unless it is a landmine or spring defence).
This is so the plugin can detect when a player is hit by a defence.

## Types of Projectiles
The available projectiles is limited to certain types in the [EntityType Enum](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.htmll).
