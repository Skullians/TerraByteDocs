description: Short overview of the defences entities configuration.
---

Each defence allows you to configure which entities can be targeted by the defence.\
See the below instructions on how to configure this aspect of defences.

## Global Config
The global configuration for all defences is located in `/plugins/SkyFactionsReborn/defences.yml`.\
It allows you to configure several aspects of the defences.

```yaml
# This is the global configuration for all defences.
# This will apply to all defences (unless they override it in per-defence configs), combined with the per-defence config.
global:
  # Global configuration for entities.
  entities:
    # You can edit what entities are deemed as "passive".
    passive-entities:
      - "ALLAY"
      - "ARMADILLO"
      - "AXOLOTL"
      - "BEE"
      - "CAMEL" # Shortened for conciseness

    # You can edit what entities are deemed as "hostile".
    hostile-entities:
      - "BAT"
      - "BLAZE"
      - "BOGGED" # Shortened for conciseness

    # What entities should be blocked?
    # See https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
    # There is no need to include entity types such as arrows!
    # Read https://docs.terrabytedev.com/skyfactions/mechanics/defences/managing_entities.html for more detail into integrations
    entity-list: [ "" ]
```

The `global` section will apply **on top of** the per-defence configs (found in each lang folder), unless `override-global-config` is enabled.\
To blacklist certain entities, you must add the entity into a new line (see https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html).

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
    SkyFactions hooks into multiple plugins to allow integrations into the features they provide.\
    See [Integrations](./integrations) for more info.

## Example Per-Defence Config
```yaml
# This allows you to configure what entities will be targeted by the defence.
entities:
  # This stops the global entities config in defences.yml from being applied (additionally) to the below configs.
  # See https://docs.terrabytedev.com/skyfactions/mechanics/defences/managing_entities.html#global-config
  override-global-config: false

  # The below booleans for hostile and passive mobs only apply if you are not overriding the global config (above).
  # Lets the defence target hostile entities (e.g. zombies)
  allow-hostile-targeting: true
  # Lets the player toggle hostile entity targeting.
  allow-toggle-hostile-targeting: true
  # Target hostile entities by default when first placed down.
  target-hostile-on-default: true

  # Lets the defence target passive entities (e.g. cows)
  allow-passive-targeting: true
  # Lets the player toggle passive entity targeting.
  allow-toggle-passive-targeting: true
  # Target passive entities by default when first placed down.
  target-passive-on-default: false

  # Allows the defence to attack players (who are raiding you only!)
  allow-attack-players: true

  # Whether the ENTITY_LIST is a whitelist of entities that can be targeted.
  # This does not override the global defence entity config, or the above booleans.
  whitelist: false
  # What entities should be blacklisted or whitelisted?
  # See https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
  # Read https://docs.terrabytedev.com/skyfactions/mechanics/defences/managing_entities.html for more detail into integrations
  entity-list: [ ]
```

The entities section is very detailed and allows extensive customisation.
To blacklist / whitelist certain entities, you must add the entity into a new line (see https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html).
