title: Runes
description: A new currency type used to administrate your island or faction.
---

Runes are an important resource in SkyFactionsReborn. Runes are used to upgrade the island, especially defenses, as well as repair the defenses after a raid. Using the Obelisk, navigate to the Runes page, which opens up an inventory GUI that you can use to sell Runes. By default, any blocks except ores have a base reward system of 1 Rune per 4 blocks. However, ores have another configurable reward system.

The first section simply allows you to change the base reward for runes given. Next, you can filter lore or enchants, perhaps to limit *accidentally* selling an important item to the Obelisk. Furthermore, you can filter specific materials, either in a blacklist or whitelist. Finally, at the bottom of the config is a custom reward system based on the [Material](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/Material.html).

config-version: 1

# Runes are SkyFaction's 'currency'. It allows you to advance in the game,
# including purchase defences, upgrade islands / factions and more.

# To gain Runes, you can convert blocks into Runes.
# This configuration file allows you to customise the amount of Runes
# that players will get per block / item, as well as override it
# for certain blocks.

# This is the base configuration for runes.
# Unless overriden in the OVERRIDES section, all items & blocks
# will apply to this configuration.
runes:
  for-each: 4 # For every 4 blocks / items input...
  give: 1 # You will get one rune in return.

# General filters to what items / blocks are allowed or not.
filters:
  allow-lore: true # Allow items with custom lore.
  allow-enchants: true # Allow items with enchants.
  allow-oraxen-items: false # Allow the outright selling of Oraxen items. Unless overriden in the OVERRIDES section with their respective ID, the prices will be default.
  allow-itemsadder-items: false # Allows the outright selling of ItemsAdder items. Read the line above.

  materials:
    # If enabled, all items in list will not be convertible. If disabled, only items in list will be convertible.
    # The OVERRIDES entries bypass this.

# Runes given PER ITEM.
# For itemsadder / oraxen compatibility:
# Specify the ID of the item, beginning with the prefix "ITEMSADDER:" or "ORAXEN:"
# E.g. "ITEMSADDER:ITEM_ID: 5" would give 5 runes per itemsadder item (with the id of ITEM_ID).
