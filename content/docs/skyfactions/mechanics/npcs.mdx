description: A detailed guide concerning SkyFaction's NPC integrations.
---

SkyFactions hooks into multiple NPC Plugins to allow for **per-island NPCs**.
This plugin hooks into:

- ZNPCsPlus
- FancyNPCs

**We will not be supporting Citizens for the forseeable future, due to its limitations.**\
**Furthermore, Citizens has a reputation for being laggy, whereas ZNPCsPlus and FancyNPCs are packet based, causing far less lag.**

# Configuring NPC Integrations

This is the default NPCs section in the `config.yml` file.
```yaml
# SkyFactions can hook into numerous NPC plugins to add support
# for per-island NPCs, such as Jerry from Hypixel SkyBlock.
# You can configure the system for this here.
npc:
  # Whether the NPC system should be enabled or not.
  # If you disable this after previously having it enabled, YOU MUST RUN /sf disablenpcs
  enabled: false

  # If you have updated the skin of the NPC, or any other attribute you must
  # run /sf updatenpcs.

  # Specify which NPC plugin (factory) to use.
  # Possible factories: "znpcpsplus" / "fancynpcs"
  # Specifing an invalid factory or a factory that is not installed will
  # cause the plugin to disable.
  factory: "znpcsplus"

  # Customise the entity of the NPC.
  # See https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.1/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html for a list
  # of valid entity types.
  entity:
    # Entity type for player islands.
    player-islands: "PLAYER"

    # Entity type for faction islands.
    faction-islands: "PLAYER"

  # Configure the names of the NPC.
  # Unfortunately these cannot be configure in individual language files due to limitations. (Global Only).
  names:
    # NPC name for player islands,
    # You can use the placeholder "%player_name%" to display the name of the player.
    # This placeholder does not apply for faction island NPC names!
    player-islands: "<blue>Sky Master"

    # NPC Name for faction islands.
    # You can use the placeholder "%faction_name%" to display the name of the faction instead.
    faction-islands: "<blue>Sky Master"

  # Allows you to configure the skin of the NPCs for island and faction islands
  # Skin Format:
  # "url:skin_url_here" - Specify a URL to a skin texture: ZNPCsPlus and FancyNPCs only.
  # "player:name_of_player_here" - Specify the name of a player who's skim you want to display.
  # "texture:texture_data_here" - Provide the texture data of the skin manually.
  # None - no player skin, will go to the default of whatever factory provider plugin you use.
  skins:
    # Skin of the NPC on player islands.
    # You can use the placeholder "%player_name%" for it to be the skin of the island's owner.
    # The above placeholder does not work on the Faction Island NPC skins!
    player-islands: "player:%player_name%"

    # Skin of the NPC on faction islands.
    # You can use the "%faction_owner%" placeholder to display the skim of the faction's owner.
    faction-islands: "player:%faction_owner"

  # This allows you to configure the offsets of where the NPC
  # will spawn, relative to the center of the island.
  offsets:
    # How far from the center of player islands should the NPC be spawned?
    player-islands: [ 2, 0, 2 ] # [x, y, z]

    # How far from the center of faction islands should the NPC be spawned?
    faction-islands: [ 2, 0, 2 ] # [x, y, z]
```

## Actions
The actions configuration allows you to configure what the plugin will do when the NPCs are interacted with.
See the below table for the possible actions.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
  All the actions support PlaceholderAPI parsing, [color parsing](../configuration/languages.mdx#text-colours--rgb).\
  You can **additionally** use the placholder `%player_name%` to fetch the name of the player who interacted with the NPC.
