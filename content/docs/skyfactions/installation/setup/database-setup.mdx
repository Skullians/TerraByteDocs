title: Database Setup
description: A small guide for setting up databases (optional).

By default, SkyFactions uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), an efficient single-file-based storage implementation.\
We also support [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), all of which you can configure at the very top of the `config.yml`.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  Modifications to the database configurations require a restart to take effect.

  **Tip:** After modifying configs, consider validating your `.yml` configs through an online YAML validator such as [YAMLlint](https://www.yamllint.com/).
