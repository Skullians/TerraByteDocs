SkyFactions requires at two separate worlds: One for the player islannds, and one for Faction islands.\
Both island types must be in separate worlds due to the varied island schematics and region sizes for both island types, among other reasons.

Currently, SkyFactions will **not** create these worlds for you. You must use a worlds management plugin such as [MyWorlds](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/myworlds.39594/) to create the worlds.\
By default, the player islands world name defaults to `player_islands` and `faction_islands` for faction islands. This is all configurable in the `config.yml`.

  We do not recommend using MultiVerse. They have various bugs and certain thinks (such as how inventories are stored in a proprietary format) that make them very difficult to migrate from.

To create void worlds with MyWorlds, you can use the following command:\
`/myworlds create WORLD_NAME/flat::minecraft:air;minecraft:the_void;nostructures`

This command will vary for your preferred world manager - You will need to run the command twice, once for player islands and once for faction islands.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  After modifying configs, consider validating your `.yml` configs through an online YAML validator such as [YAMLlint](https://www.yamllint.com/).
