<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  Read each part of this guide carefully otherwise your island schematics may not work as intended.
</Callout>


SkyFactions uses [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/) to paste in islands upon creation, in the form of WorldEdit schematics.\
We do not recommend normal WorldEdit due to FAWE being much faster.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
  You must create the island schematics yourself!\
  If you do not wish to create them, you can find schematics on websites such as PlanetMinecraft.
</Callout>

You must have two schematics: One for player islands and one for faction islands.\
(You can alternatively have one island for both player islands & faction islands by settings the schematic file names in `config.yml` to the same filename)

These schematics must be placed in the `plugins/SkyFactionsReborn/schematics` folder, and the names of the schematic files must be configured in the `config.yml` so that the plugin knows what file to use.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
  When making a selection and running `//copy`, ensure that the origin of the schematic (where you stand when you actually save the schematic) **must be where you want the player to spawn!**
  The origin should bethe **centre** of each island region.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  After modifying configs, consider validating your `.yml` configs through an online YAML validator such as [YAMLlint](https://www.yamllint.com/).
