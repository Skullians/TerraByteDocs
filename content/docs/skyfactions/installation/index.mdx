title: Initial Steps
description: An overview of the installation process of SFR, which is similar to installing most plugins.
---

## Installation
Installing the plugin is simple. Just drop the .jar right into your `plugins` folder and restart/start your server.\
Ensure you install the required dependencies and you comply with the system requirements below.

## System requirements

* **Java 21** - This plugin currently only supports 1.21, which requires Java 21.
* **Minecraft Edition** - Java Edition running Paper (recommended) or its forks Pufferfish or Purpur. We also support Folia, ShreddedPaper, and MultiPaper.
* **Version** - Currently, this plugin is only built for Minecraft 1.21 and onwards, but backwards compatibility will be explored in future releases.
* **Hardware** - For a medium-sized server, it is highly recommended to use at least 4 GB of RAM. Some of our dependencies and operations can be resource-intensive and choke old CPUs. However, we prioritized performing as many checks and operations asynchronously when possible, so you shouldn't notice performance issues.

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/) - Faction & Player Island generation. Also just a highly necessary tool for any server. Executes operations asynchronously, so they don't hog the main thread and executes them way faster.
* [WorldGuard](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard) - Used for region defining and executing operations within said regions. Also an extremely useful tool on any server.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
  The plugin will not load without these plugins installed.
</Callout>

### Soft Dependencies
Adds extra features to the plugin, but the plugin will automatically detect if they aren't installed and proceed without them with no issues.

* [Jukebox](https://github.com/SkytAsul/JukeBox) - Hooks into JukeBox to stop any music to allow for raid music.
* [NoteblockAPI](https://github.com/koca2000/NoteBlockAPI) - A dependency for Jukebox itself, also used for providing raid music.
* [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) - If for some reason a server owner has no reason to use placeholders, this isn't a required dependency.
* [Defence Plugin Integrations](../mechanics/defences/integrations) - Plugins that SkyFactions hooks into to enhance the defences mechanic.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  All of these integrations can be enabled / disabled in the `config.yml`, under `integrations`.\
  By default, they are all enabled.
</Callout>

## Updating the Plugin

Updating SkyFactions is _typically_ as simple as replacing the .jar in your plugins folder.

<Callout type="info" title="Hint">
  A little known feature with Paper is that if you add a directory in your plugins folder called "update" and drag and drop the new version in there, 
  it will automatically replace it on server restart.

  However, if you make major, game-altering changes to the config, you may have problems between versions as the config changes and "overwrites" your configurations. The plugin will _try_ not to do this.
</Callout>

It's also recommended to update the dependencies. We make comments in our [changelog](https://discord.com/channels/1252801398601420852/1253064708530110484) about this as much as possible, and will announce if a dependency plugin needs an update as we update the main plugin version.
Updating instructions will also be present in our [Updating Section](/docs/skyfactions/updating).

If you're updating your server, that should be fine. However, never downgrade your server version, as it will corrupt your world permanently.

## Additional Plugin Recommendations
* [MyWorlds](https://github.com/bergerhealer/MyWorlds) - Or any world manager for that matter, although SkyFactionsReborn was built with MyWorlds in mind. It's the most stable world manager on the market.
* [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) - Running a server without LuckPerms in 2024? Couldn't be me.
* [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/DiscordSRV/DiscordSRV) - A great plugin to link Discord and Minecraft together seamlessly. Not necessarily required for the webhook feature, but useful nonetheless.

## Incompatibilites

* BetterRTP - It really doesn't make sense to use an RTP plugin on a Skyblock server. If you have any need for it, disable its use in the island world(s).
* Any Factions plugin - The use of other faction plugins on the server may result in unintended bugs and limited functionality.
* Any Skyblock plugin - You do NOT need to install any Skyblock plugin beside SkyFactionsReborn on your server and it will only cause problems if you do so.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Moral of the story:\
  Don't be dumb. Think abuot what might affect / impact the functionality of this plugin.\
  If you're unsure, ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SwxXMrFdjp).

## Reloading

<Callout type="warn" title="Caution!">
  Do not use `/reload` or plugin reloaders such as Plugman(X) to reload this plugin.\
  It will cause unintended functionality of **multiple plugins** on your server - You should always restart your server.

  You can reload the configuration files of our plugin using `/sf reload`.\
  Certain configurations require a restart, such as Database configuration.
