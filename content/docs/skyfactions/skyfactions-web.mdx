import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  This section is a work-in-progress, as the web module is unfinished.

  **This guide is written out-of-the-box for Ubuntu 22.04. If you use a different OS (e.g. Debian 12) you will have to do some research about how to install the dependencies.**
</Callout>

## Dependencies
* PHP 8.1+
* A database that supports MySQL (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that SkyFactions is linked to. **The web module does not support SQLite.**
* Nginx (or similar, this guide is designed for Nginx).
* Certbot (for SSL certificates, **optional**).

### Example Dependencies Installation
```bash
# OPTIONAL: MariaDB repository setup script for Ubuntu 20.04.
curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx mariadb-server
```

## Required Ports
* Nginx - 80 (for HTTP), 443 for HTTPS.
* Database - 3306 (assuming you use the default port and your database is on a different server).

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Clone Repository
        Clone the GitHub repository to download all necessary files.
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/JerichoTorrent/SkyFactions-web.git
        cd SkyFactions-web/web-interface
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure Database
        After installing the necessary files, you can use a text editor like `nano` to edit `db_connect.php`, and enter your database connection details.
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install nano
        nano db_connect.php
        ```

        <Callout type="warn" title="Note">
            This must be the database that SkyFactions is configured to use, otherwise we have no way to fetch the data.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        You can edit any other files such as `styles.css` to modify the appearance of the site as you please.\
        However, it is not recommended to modify other PHP files unless you know what you are doing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Webserver configuration

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### DNS Record Configuration
        <Callout type="info" title="Note">
            You can skip this step if you are not using a domain.
        </Callout>

        In your domain's DNS settings, create an A record with you intended subdomain (e.g. `sky` for `sky.example.com`), pointing to the public IP of the server that is running the web module.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Nginx Configuration
        Create a new Nginx configuration file for the web interface, named after your domain.\
        E.g.: `nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/sky.example.com`.

        Paste the following text into the file.
        ```nginx
        server {
            # This can also be a numerical IP.
            # Replace `sky.example.com` with your domain / IP.
            server_name sky.example.com; // [!code highlight]

            # Root directory for the web files
            root /home/ubuntu/SkyFactions-web/web-interface; // [!code highlight]
            index index.php index.html index.htm;

            # Access and error logs
            access_log /var/log/nginx/skyfactions_access.log;
            error_log /var/log/nginx/skyfactions_error.log;

            # Serve static files directly
            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }

            # PHP file handling
            location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                # Adjust PHP version as necessary
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock; // [!code highlight]
            }
        }
        ```

        After you have edited and saved the file with `ctrl+x` and `y`, create a symlink to the `sites-enabled` directory.
        ```bash
        ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sky.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        ```

        Once your changes are complete, run `nginx -t` to check for syntax errors, and then `systemctl restart nginx` to apply the changes.

        You can now visit your website at `http://<your ip address>/index.php` or `http://sky.example.com/index.php` if you have set up a domain.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Generate SSL Certificates
        <Callout type="info" title="Note">
            You can skip this step if you are not using a domain.
        </Callout>

        Now we can generate an SSL certificate for the site you have created.\
        Ensure you have Certbot installed, and run the following command:
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --ngnix -d sky.example.com # Replace 'sky.example.com' with your domain.
        ```

        If the certificate creation is successful, your site should be up and running and you can access it via `https://sky.example.com/index.php`.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        <Callout type="info" title="Note">
            This step is optional for those who are using a domain with SSL certificates.
        </Callout>

        If you wish, you can schedule a cron job to automatically renew your SSL certificates.\
        To do this, install `cron` and enter crontab.
        ```bash
        sudo apt install cron
        sudo crontab -e
        ```

        At the bottom of the file, add the following line to renew the certificates every day at 11PM.
        ```cron
        0 23 * * * certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook "systemctl restart nginx"
        ```

        In this job, Certbot will renew silently and will then restart Nginx to apply the changes.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

* Use your actual domain. Don't use example.com. You obviously don't own that domain.
* If you use a different operating system, you will need to research how to install the dependencies manually. Google is your friend here!
* If you get an error 404, your webserver config is incorrect.
* If you get a 502 bad gateway, again, your webserver config is incorrect.
* If you get a HTTP error on one of the sub-pages (anything other than index.php), check your browser console for details. It is likely that the database configuration is incorrect (see `db_connect.php`).
