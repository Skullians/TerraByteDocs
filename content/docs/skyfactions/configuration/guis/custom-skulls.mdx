title: Custom Skulls
description: Guide on custom skull usage in GUIs.
---

As mentioned in the [GUI Items Configuration](./index.mdx#gui-items), the GUI configuration system allows you to use customised skulls in your GUIs.

```yaml
items:
  # View all your incoming join requests from players.
  incoming-invites:
    char: "i"
    material: "PLAYER_HEAD"
    skull: "eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvOTY4M2RjN2JjNmRiZGI1ZGM0MzFmYmUyOGRjNGI5YWU2MjViOWU1MzE3YTI5ZjJjNGVjZmU3YmY1YWU1NmMzOCJ9fX0="
    text: "<aqua>Join Requests"
    sound: ""
    pitch: 1
    lore:
      - "<yellow>View, accept and deny"
      - "<yellow>your incoming join requests."
```

They require the material to be `PLAYER_HEAD` and the texture value must be a valid Base64 Encoded string.

    You can find custom head textures from sites such as [MCHeads.com](https://mc-heads.com/) and [Minecraft-Heads.com](https://minecraft-heads.com/).

Find a skull you like, and find the "Texture Value" or "Base64 Encoded String".

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
    The texture value should be a long string of mixed letters and numbers.\
    For example: `eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvZjFhZTgwMzg0YTAwYjZmOWY2NGRkODMwN2E5MDY3NjU0NGM5N`
</Callout>

Paste the value into the `skull` value of your desired item, and ensure `material` is set to `PLAYER_HEAD`.
Reload the configuration via `/sf reload` and the changes will apply.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
    You can use `<player_skull>` in all skull values for items to return the player's skull (of who opened the GUI).
