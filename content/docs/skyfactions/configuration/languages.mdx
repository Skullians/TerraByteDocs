SkyFactions has an advanced multi-language system.\
This allows you to configure different language and have the plugin automatically detect a player's locale and send the correct message locale (assuming you have their locale configured).\
If you do not have their locale configured, it will revert to the default specified in `config.yml`.

The plugin will automatically ship with the English language configuration. As of 2nd January 2025, there are no other languages available.\
The defence configs and gui configs are duplicated across each language file, meaning if you make a non-language specific adjustment on one, you must reflect it on the others. There is no automation for this.

The default English configuration is located at `/plugins/SkyFactionsReborn/language/en_US/`. You will find an `en_US.yml` file, `defences` folder and `guis` folder.

  Once making adjustments, you can run `/sf reload` on the server (either via the console or as a player with permissions to do so) to instantly refresh the configurations!

Every config has a description (in comment form) of what it corresponds to, making configuring all messages and other configs trivial.

## Text Colours / RGB
SkyFactionsReborn uses the [MiniMessage Format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html), allowing for extensive customisation and familiarity when it comes to stylising your messages with gradients, fonts and more.

All message configs *also* support placeholders from [PlaceholderAPI](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/), so you can access placeholders outside of SkyFactions.
