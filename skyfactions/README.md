# SkyFactionsReborn

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation is still a WIP. Things may change.

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for SkyFactionsReborn.\
This plugin elegantly merges features from Skyblock and Factions.\
Skyblock, even when played on a big network, can get quite lonely. That's why we combined it with Factions and expanded on the gamemode tenfold.\
This seemed like an obvious synthesis to explore. This plugin has several dependencies, comes with **MANY** features, but everything is laid out intuitively for the server owner.

## Features

* Advanced raid mechanics, placeholders, and rewards.
* Player island and faction island generation; hooks nicely with a world manager like MyWorlds.
* Faction generation facilitated by the [KingdomsX API](https://github.com/CryptoMorin/KingdomsX)
* Custom unique currency system called "gems" and a provided (optional) resource pack for them.
* Much, much more to come!
