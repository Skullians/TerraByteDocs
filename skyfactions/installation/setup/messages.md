# Messages

## Message Config

Every message in the plugin (item names, command responses, etc.) are all configurable.\
You can find the config at `plugins/SkyFactionsReborn/messages.yml`.

Every entry has a description of what it corresponds to, making configuring all messages easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
After modifying configs, consider validating your .yml configs through an online YAML validator such as [YAMLlint](https://www.yamllint.com/).
{% endhint %}
