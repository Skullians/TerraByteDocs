# Factions Overview
Factions is one of the most important features of SkyFactions.
It allows multiple individuals to group together and start another island (on top of their private, individual islands), raid other Factions and more.

By default, it costs **100 Runes** to create a Faction, which is configurable in the `config.yml`.
